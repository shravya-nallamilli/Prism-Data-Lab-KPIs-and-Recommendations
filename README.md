---

## Project Overview
The project highlights:
- Development of a central dashboard for monitoring KPIs.
- Insights into metrics like **Profit Margin**, **Refund Rate**, **ROAS**, and **Retention Rate**.
- Strategic recommendations for improving profitability and customer engagement.

## Project Context and Insights

### Context
- Prism currently lacks a central dashboard to monitor business health and track KPIs, making critical decisions challenging. 
- As part of Quadrangle, aligning with their data-driven vision is key. 
- The dashboard we've created will aid in driving efficiency and supporting Prism's growth.

### KPIs and Their Importance
- **Profit Margin**: Reflects sustainable operations and efficiency.
- **Refund Rate**: Signals product quality and customer satisfaction.
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Measures the value of marketing investments.
- **Retention Rate**: Tracks customer loyalty.
- **Conversion Rate**: Reveals how effectively visitors are turned into buyers.

These KPIs collectively reflect profitability, customer behavior, and marketing impact, making them critical metrics for driving Prism's business decisions.

### Key Data Insights

#### **Profit Margin**
- The profit margin graph shows significant fluctuations over the two-year period.
- In mid-2020, margins drop below 46%, likely due to increased operational costs (e.g., supply chain disruptions).
- By late 2021, margins recover above 52%, reflecting reduced costs and optimised pricing strategies.

#### **Refund Rate**
- Refund rates peak above 35% in mid-2021, likely due to unmet customer expectations or unreliable courier services.
- By late 2021, refund rates drop below 20%, indicating successful corrective measures (e.g., improved processes and addressing customer concerns).

#### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- Meta consistently outperforms Google in ROAS from July 2020 onward, likely due to better targeting algorithms.
- Google achieves strong ROAS early in 2020 but declines due to increased competition and costs.

### Recommendations
Based on the data insights, we propose the following actions:
1. Release new collections in low-profit months.
2. Send post-purchase surveys to identify refund causes.
3. Reallocate 20% of Google's budget to Meta.
4. Develop a subscription loyalty program.
5. Introduce guest checkout to boost conversions.
6. Improve advertisements and promotions during spring and summer.
7. Offer personalized bounce-back offers during June/July.

These recommendations aim to:
- Stabilise profit margins.
- Reduce refund rates.
- Enhance customer loyalty.
- Ensure efficient ad spend and reduce cart abandonment.
