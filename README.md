---

## üìä Project Context and Insights

### Context
- Prism lacked a centralised dashboard to monitor business health and track KPIs, making critical decisions challenging.
- As part of Quadrangle, aligning with their data-driven vision was essential.
- The developed dashboard drives efficiency and supports Prism's growth.

### KPIs and Their Importance
- **Profit Margin**: Indicates operational efficiency and sustainability.
- **Refund Rate**: Reflects customer satisfaction and product quality.
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: Evaluates marketing effectiveness.
- **Retention Rate**: Measures customer loyalty.
- **Conversion Rate**: Highlights sales effectiveness.

These KPIs collectively provide a comprehensive view of Prism's business health.

### üîë Key Insights

#### **Profit Margin**
- Margins dropped below 46% in mid-2020 due to increased operational costs (e.g., supply chain disruptions).
- Margins recovered above 52% by late 2021, driven by cost reductions and pricing optimisation.

#### **Refund Rate**
- Refund rates peaked at 35% in mid-2021 due to customer dissatisfaction.
- Rates fell below 20% by late 2021, following process improvements and customer feedback measures.

#### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
- Meta consistently outperformed Google in ROAS post-July 2020 due to better targeting algorithms.
- Google experienced a decline in ROAS due to rising competition and costs.

### üìã Recommendations
1. Release new collections in low-profit months.
2. Conduct post-purchase surveys to address refund causes.
3. Reallocate 20% of Google's budget to Meta for higher returns.
4. Introduce a subscription loyalty program to improve retention.
5. Enable guest checkout to boost conversion rates.
6. Increase ad spend during spring and summer to match demand.
7. Use personalised bounce-back offers in June/July to reduce churn.
